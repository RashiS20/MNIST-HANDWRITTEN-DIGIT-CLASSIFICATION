# MNIST HANDWRITTEN DIGIT CLASSIFICATION USING MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING

The MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification model uses convolutional neural networks to train a variety of image processing systems. The dataset recognizes handwritten digits within texts by analyzing 60,000 training samples of different sizes and orientations.

## REQUIREMENTS
1. Python 3.5 +
2. Scikit-Learn (latest version)
3. Numpy (+ mkl for Windows)
4. Matplotlib
5. Keras

## MNIST dataset
MNIST is a collection of handwritten digits from 0-9. Image of size 28 X 28.



## Introduction

MNIST contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits: 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing. The images are grayscale, 28x28 pixels, and centered to reduce preprocessing and get started quicker.

Keras is a high-level neural network API focused on user friendliness, fast prototyping, modularity and extensibility. It works with deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow, Theano and CNTK, so we can get right into building and training a neural network without a lot of fuss.
## Demo

All the outputs are shown in the jupyter notebook file given in repository.
